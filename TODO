Bindings
--------

Planned keybindings.

* h, l -> img prev, img next 
* j, k -> down next, up prev # scroll until edge, then jump to next/prev image

* a, w, s, d -> left, up, down, right

* z -> zoom in
* x -> zoom out

* f -> zoom fit


* r -> rotate right
* R -> rotate left


* ? -> help
* : -> Comand line


Bugs
----

- If somehow you jump to a non-preloaded image (forwarding fast or going backwards from the first img for example),
  we have no way to push it to the top of (pr)eload channel.
- Q binding requires another key press to work.
